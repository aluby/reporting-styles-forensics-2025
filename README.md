# reporting-styles-forensics

Summer 2025 research project at Carleton College investigating reporting styles of forensic scientists

#### The following is a list of everything in the repository. It contains information on where to find everything mentioned in our paper.

-   **`README_DATA` —** contains additional information of the data sets used for our analysis, along with non-fingerprint data sets that our model could be applied to. It details all of the things we changed about the original data sets and what each variable represents. This file also contains links to all of the original studies.

    -   **`data_unchanged` —** reads in all of the original data sets, both the ones directly used in our analysis and the ones that our model could be fit to.

    -   **`data_changed` —** contains all of the mutated data sets

    -   **`data_cleaning.qmd` —** all of the code used to mutate the data sets

-   **`paper-graphs.qmd` —** all of the code used to create all of the graphs in our paper

-   `Final simulations.R` — all of the code used to carry out simulations. Each simulation setting is included in its own section in the file with comments throughout explaining each one.

-   **`Graph_images` —** all of the image files of the graphs used in our paper
