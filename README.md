# reporting-styles-forensics

Summer 2025 research project at Carleton College investigating reporting styles of forensic scientists

The data_cleaning.qmd file contains all code used to mutate the data sets mentioned throughout our paper. More information on the data sets can be found in the README_data.md file. The data_changed folder contains the final, mutated data, while the data_unchanged folder contains the original data sets.

All code used to make our results graphs can be found in the paper-graphs.qmd file.

All simulation data and analysis can be found in the simulation_data folder.

Finally, our the code we used to fit our final model can be found in the Raw Stan Code and Brms Code folders, depending on which coding style you prefer. The Brms code runs faster, but we had less control over the final model, which is why we implemented both coding formats in our analysis.
